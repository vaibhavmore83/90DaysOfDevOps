## 90-day personal DevOps learning plan

DevOps is a cultural and technical approach that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The Core goal is to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with continuous improvement. 
Whereas Cloud engineering focuses on designing, building, and managing systems in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). The Core goal is to create scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud environments.

I have more than 19 years of IT experience including 12 years in DevOps and 7 years in Software Configuration Management (SCM).

Mine existing DevOps journey is around on-premises package build and deployments missing industry widely used Cloud deployments and managements experience. I need to upskill my DevOps knowledge with these new tech stacks to speed up with the industry standards.
